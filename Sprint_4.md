## Description:
Inventory control, also known as stock control, is the process of managing your company’s inventory levels in one or multiple locations. Basically, tracking items and making sure your business keeps the optimal number of parts or products in stock, whether it’s online, on the shelf, or both. An inventory control system also watches your products’ usage, storage, and movement—from its stock room arrival up to customer shipment arrival.

While focusing on the removal of slow-selling products and increasing the number of high-selling, you’ll maximize your profits, while saving time, resources, and money with the least amount of inventory sitting in your warehouse.
